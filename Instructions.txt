The candidate should do at home the following mini-project between phonescreen interview and on-site/online second stage interview.

Create a Phonebook Agenda Application with mocked data on the serverside.
Use either Angular or React or Vue, whichever you feel most comfortable with.

There is no need for a REST server as backend server.
We are interested only in the UI components.

Person details

first name
last name
company
phone number
notes

Screen 1 - Table with Persons

sortable columns
search box
dropdown with selection by company

e.g. Connectors view from Conduit project

Screen 2 - Add new person

person details input fields
click on button to “add new entry”
popup page
save button

e.g. add a Connector view from Conduit project

Screen 3 - Edit details of an entry

update phone number

Screen 4 - View person details

looking to see use of query params and router configuration

e.g. click edit a connector on the connectors view from Conduit project

Hints:

what we look for:
Architecture, how good is the code in following well established design patterns
Code Style, how readable is the code
Functionality, how much of the functionality is implemented
Stability, how many bugs does it have
Design, how good does it look


This project should take no more than 6h / candidate.
We don’t expect a perfect project.
We only expect some familiarity with most used UI frameworks.

This project will serve as a base of the discussion for the second-stage interview.
